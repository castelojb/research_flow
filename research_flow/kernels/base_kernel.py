    Abstract base class for kernels that transform input data.

    A kernel is a transformation pipeline that takes input data of type `InType` and produces output data of type `OutType`.
    This class provides a framework for defining and chaining kernels.

    Subclasses should implement the `pipeline_graph` property to define their own transformation logic.

    Attributes:
        pipeline_graph: A valid `Transformer` object from the `gloe` package that defines the transformation pipeline.

    Methods:
        transform(data: InType) -> OutType: Applies the pipeline graph to the input data.
        __call__(data: InType) -> OutType: Applies the pipeline graph to the input data (equivalent to `transform`).
        __rshift__(other: Union["BaseKernel", Transformer]) -> "UnionKernel": Chains multiple kernels together.

    Notes:
        This class is abstract and cannot be instantiated directly.

        Overload the `__rshift__` operator.

        This method allows you to chain multiple `BaseKernel` instances together.
        It takes another `BaseKernel` or `Transformer` instance and returns a new
        `UnionKernel` instance that represents the composition of the two.

        Parameters
        ----------
        other: Union["BaseKernel", Transformer]
            The other `BaseKernel` or `Transformer` instance to be composed.

        Returns
        -------
        UnionKernel

        -----
        This method is used to implement the `>>` operator.
